# AIM Agent Overview

The AIM Agent acts as the interface between software workloads (AI/graphics/custom) and the underlying Algorithmic Intelligent Mechanism (AIM) hardware. Its responsibilities include job scheduling, instruction encoding, resource management, and status/result collection. The agent can run as a user-space daemon, kernel driver, or firmware, and is designed to support both API calls and direct hardware control for maximum flexibility.

## Key Features
- Translates high-level API calls into AIM instructions.
- Schedules jobs and manages hardware queues.
- Collects, verifies, and returns results to host or client.
- Monitors hardware status and performance.
- Supports programmable AI controller hooks for self-optimization.

## Example Agent Skeleton (Python)
```python
import time
from aim_device_api import AIMDevice

class AIMAgent:
    def __init__(self, dev_path="/dev/aim0"):
        self.dev = AIMDevice(dev_path)

    def submit_and_wait(self, instr, data):
        self.dev.submit_job(instr, data)
        while self.dev.query_status():
            time.sleep(0.01)
        return self.dev.get_result()

    def shutdown(self):
        self.dev.close()
```
